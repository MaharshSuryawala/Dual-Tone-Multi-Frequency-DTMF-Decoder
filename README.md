# Dual-Tone-Multi-Frequency-DTMF-Decoder

## Overview 

* DTMF stands for Dual Tone Multiple Frequency, it's a telecommunication signaling system using voice-frequency band over telephone lines. 
* It is also known as Touch-Tone. 
* Every button in the keyboard, when pressed will generate a superimposed sine wave of multiple frequencies. 
* Each number will possess different tone basedon the frequency it generates.
* This Touch-Tone service for telephone keyboard has gradually replaced the use of Rotary dial and has become the industry standard for Landline and Mobile devices.
* Originally DTMF was decoded using filter banks but now Digital Signal Processing is the predominant technology.
* We have implemented 

## Implementation
* We’ve implemented DTMF using software as well as hardware. 
* Moroever, we’ve implemented basic filters to simulate and analyze logic of how DTMF works. 
* Software part is implemented in MATLAB using ‘The Goertzel Algorithm’ and hardware is onbreadboard using resistors and capacitors.
